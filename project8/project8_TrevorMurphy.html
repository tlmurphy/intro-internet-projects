    <p style="font-style: italic">A reality show star would entail being a popular figure who
    stars in a show in which the show's content revolves around my life. I would
    simply live my amazing life while others would <br> be able to watch and
    envy the activities I get to do and the relationships I form. While my
    privacy might be almost non-existent, I would gain significant
    recognition and even have my <br> own fan club. I'm not sure what
    the exact salary would be, but I anticipate it to be in the millions
    because of how interesting my life/show would be.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold">My dream place to have this job would be in North Korea. This
    location would definitely make the show more interesting as I would
    be living in a horrible environment and facing many <br> issues with
    government and life in general. I feel like this location would
    be the best place to have a reality tv show! The chances of
    getting to be a reality tv star in North Korea are very <br> low though
    since it is extrememly difficult to get into and out of the country
    but I will try my hardest to make this dream a reality!</p>
