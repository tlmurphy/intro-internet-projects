    <h1>Your Lie in April</h1>
    <h2>Directed by Kyohei Ishiguro</h2>
    <p><b>Kousei Arima</b>, a young and gifted piano prodigy, dominated the <br/>
      piano competitions and became famous among child musicians for his <br/>
      <i>cold</i> and <i>calculated</i> piano playing. After his abusive <br/>
      who was also his piano instructor, died, Kousei suffered from a mental <br/>
      breakdown and became unable to play the piano. Two years later, <br/>
      Kousei hasn't touched the piano and views the world in monochrome, <br/>
      without any flair or color. He has resigned himself to living out his <br/>
      life with his good friends, <b>Tsubaki</b> and <b>Watari</b>, until, one day, <br/>
      a girl changes everything. <b>Kaori Miyazono</b>, a fourteen-year old <br/>
      audacious, free-spirited violinist whose playing style reflects her <br/>
      manic personality, helps Kousei return to the music world and shows <br/>
      that playing music should be free and fluid, unlike the structured <br/>
      and rigid style Kousei was used to.
